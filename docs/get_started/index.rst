--------------------------------------------------
Configure your workstation for Pigweed development
--------------------------------------------------
Pigweed does its best to bundle all its dependencies into an isolated
environment using :ref:`module-pw_env_setup`. While this doesn't eliminate
all prerequisites, it greatly accelerates new developer onboarding.

The first-time setup guides below are required for any Pigweed-based project,
but only need to be done once per machine.

      Prerequisites, first-time setup, and support notes for Linux, macOS, and
      Windows.

      :link: docs-get-started-bazel
      :link-type: ref
      :class-item: sales-pitch-cta-primary

      Fork our minimal, Bazel-based starter code. Bazel is the recommended
      build system for new projects using Pigweed.

      :class-item: sales-pitch-cta-secondary

      Check out the examples repo, a repository that outlines the recommended
      way to use Pigweed in a broader GN-based project. Note that Bazel is the
      recommended build system for new projects using Pigweed, whereas the
      examples repo uses GN.

      :link: docs-kudzu
      :link-type: ref
      :class-item: sales-pitch-cta-secondary

      Study the code of Kudzu, a just-for-fun Maker Faire 2023 project that
      demonstrates complex Pigweed usage. This project also uses GN.

.. tip::
   Pigweed runs ``pw format`` as part of ``pw presubmit`` to perform some code
   formatting checks. To speed up the review process, consider adding ``pw
   presubmit`` as a git push hook using the following command:
   ``pw presubmit --install``

.. _python-style:

------------
Python style
------------
Pigweed uses the standard Python style: PEP8, which is available on the web at
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/. All Pigweed Python code should pass
``pw format``, which invokes ``black`` with a couple options.

Python versions
===============
Pigweed officially supports :ref:`a few Python versions
<docs-concepts-python-version>`. Upstream Pigweed code must support those Python
versions. The only exception is :ref:`module-pw_env_setup`, which must also
support Python 2 and 3.6.

---------------
Build files: GN
---------------
Each Pigweed source module requires a GN build file named BUILD.gn. This
encapsulates the build targets and specifies their sources and dependencies.
GN build files use a format similar to `Bazel's BUILD files
<https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/build-ref.html>`_
(see the `Bazel style guide
<https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/skylark/build-style.html>`_).

C/C++ build targets include a list of fields. The primary fields are:

* ``<public>`` -- public header files
* ``<sources>`` -- source files and private header files
* ``<public_configs>`` -- public build configuration
* ``<configs>`` -- private build configuration
* ``<public_deps>`` -- public dependencies
* ``<deps>`` -- private dependencies

Assets within each field must be listed in alphabetical order.

.. code-block:: cpp

  # Here is a brief example of a GN build file.

  import("$dir_pw_unit_test/test.gni")

  config("public_include_path") {
    include_dirs = [ "public" ]
    visibility = [":*"]
  }

  pw_source_set("pw_sample_module") {
    public = [ "public/pw_sample_module/sample_module.h" ]
    sources = [
      "public/pw_sample_module/internal/secret_header.h",
      "sample_module.cc",
      "used_by_sample_module.cc",
    ]
    public_configs = [ ":public_include_path" ]
    public_deps = [ dir_pw_status ]
    deps = [ dir_pw_varint ]
  }

  pw_test_group("tests") {
    tests = [ ":sample_module_test" ]
  }

  pw_test("sample_module_test") {
    sources = [ "sample_module_test.cc" ]
    deps = [ ":sample_module" ]
  }

  pw_doc_group("docs") {
    sources = [ "docs.rst" ]
  }

------------------
Build files: Bazel
------------------
Build files for the Bazel build system must be named ``BUILD.bazel``. Bazel can
interpret files named just ``BUILD``, but Pigweed uses ``BUILD.bazel`` to avoid
ambiguity with other build systems or tooling.

Pigweed's Bazel files follow the `Bazel style guide
<https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/skylark/build-style.html>`_.

------------------
Build files: Soong
------------------
Build files (blueprints) for the Soong build system must be named
``Android.bp``. The way Pigweed modules and backends are used is documented in
:ref:`module-pw_build_android`.

.. _owners-style:

--------------------
Code Owners (OWNERS)
--------------------
If you use Gerrit for source code hosting and have the
`code-owners <https://android-review.googlesource.com/plugins/code-owners/Documentation/backend-find-owners.html>`__
plug-in enabled Pigweed can help you enforce consistent styling on those files
and also detects some errors.

The styling follows these rules.

#. Content is grouped by type of line (Access grant, include, etc).
#. Each grouping is sorted alphabetically.
#. Groups are placed the following order with a blank line separating each
   grouping.

   * "set noparent" line
   * "include" lines
   * "file:" lines
   * user grants (some examples: "*", "foo@example.com")
   * "per-file:" lines

This plugin will, by default, act upon any file named "OWNERS".
